# Maintenance Overview

## QBWA Maintenance

This section provides instructions for maintaining QBWA. QBWA should only requires changes in these scenarios:

* Scheduling: Either the frequency of the automated schedule needs to be changed or a manual QBWA run for specific dates or a specific transaction is needed.
* Updated mapping from Wild Apricot to Quickbooks:
  * Updates to Wild Apricot Member Levels, Event Tags, or Donation Campaigns
  * Updated Quickbooks accounts, items, or classes
  * Updates to Sales taxes

Recommendation: Before making significant QBWA configuration changes, use the Backup scenario to create a copy of the current configuration. Instructions for backing up the configuration and selecting new configuration records are also shown in this section.
