# Quickbooks Desktop IIF reference

This section provides a brief guide for importing IIF files into Quickbooks Desktop and for locating any error IIF files generated by Quickbooks Desktop.

IIF (Intuit Interchange Format) is a custom format created by Intuit Quickbooks.  It is an older file format that is no longer supported by Intuit, but is still commonly used by Quickbooks Desktop users.   For more information on IIF files, follow [this link](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/learn-support/en-us/import-or-export-data-files/export-import-and-edit-iif-files/00/203229), which points to Intuit's help article for IIF files.&#x20;

&#x20;2\) Click the "Open in folder" button

4\) Opening the file on your computer may depend on your operating system and applications.   IIF files are text files with a special "tab-delimited" format.  Any text viewer can view the file.   Microsoft Excel can also view the file if it is opened/imported in the proper way.



#### Interpreting IIF Import error messages

1\) After the error IIF file is opened,  you will see the top section, which includes general guidance on finding the errors in the file.

2\) The remainder of the file includes the original data from the original IIF file.  Rows with the phrase \[ERROR] will be inserted at the places where the error occurred.

3\) The text after the phrase \[ERROR] provides guidance on the error and how to fix the error.

4\) In this example, "Membership Services" does not exist inside Quickbooks Desktop as a valid Inventory List Item.  To correct, either create this as a valid item inside of Quickbooks Desktop OR change the IIF file to use an existing Inventory List Item.

5\) Quickbooks Desktop requires exact matches for many parts of the IIF file.   In other cases, the IIF import process may create a new object in Quickbooks Desktop, but this new object may not be set-up correctly to work with your business practices.
