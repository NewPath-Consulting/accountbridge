# Managing WAQM Integromat Scenarios



### Cloning Integromat Scenario for BackUp

Recommendation: Before making significant changes to an Integromat scenario, clone the scenario to create a backup of the scenario. These are standard Integromat steps:

1. From the Scenario listing or the Diagram screen: click Clone from the right hand drop-down menu. \(If you donâ€™t see the option on the diagram view, you may be in Edit mode. Exit Edit Mode.\)
2. Choose a name for the cloned scenario or use the suggested name. Leave the target organization unchanged.
3. Click OK
4. Optional: from the scenario listing, Move the new scenario to a folder using the right hand drop-down menu.
