# Overview

## WAQM Maintenance

This section provides instructions for maintaining WAQM. WAQM should only requires changes in these scenarios:

* Scheduling: Either the frequency of the automated schedule needs to be changed or a manual WAQM run for specific dates is needed.
* Updated mapping from Wild Apricot to Quickbooks:
  * Updates to Wild Apricot Member Levels, Event Tags, or Donation Campaigns
  * Updated Quickbooks accounts, items, or classes
  * Updates to Sales taxes

In some cases, further WAQM customizations may be required. Contact your NewPath Consulting contact for assistance.

Recommendation: Before making significant WAQM configuration changes, use the Backup scenario to create a copy of the current configuration. Instructions for backing up the configuration and selecting new configuration records are also shown in this section.
