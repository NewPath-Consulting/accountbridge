# WAQM Installation Overview



#### WAQM Installation Summary

NewPath Consulting's focal will work with the client to install and configure the Wild Apricot Quickbooks Manager \(WAQM\) for the client. Expect these high level steps as part of the WAQM installation process.

1. A NewPath Consulting focal will meet with the client and review existing usage of Wild Apricot and Quickbooks. An initial mapping document will be created as part of this review.
2. The client should get an [Integromat](https://www.integromat.com/) account and add the NewPath Consulting focal as an Admin user. \(a BASIC or higher Integromat subscription is required to support WAQM\)
3. The NewPath Consulting focal and the client will work jointly to establish connections from Integromat to Wild Apricot, Quickbooks Online, or other online services needed to support WAQM.
4. A NewPath Consulting focal will install the core WAQM components to the client's Integromat environment and perform the initial configuration.
5. Together, the NewPath Consulting focal and the client will perform some tests to ensure the mapping is correct and whether additional adjustments are needed.
6. Once testing is complete, the NewPath Consulting focal will train the client's focal to use and maintain WAQM.

The embedded Excel file is an example of the mapping document that can be used as part of the installation and set-up process.
