# Pre-Requisites before Installation

These accounts and items should be in place before beginning the Integromat Clone and Install process.  Either NPC staff must have the admin privileges below or the client admin must perform the steps together with NPC staff.

NOTE:  Recommended best practice is to create the required connections inside a client's Integromat account before starting with the scenario cloning process.  Integromat only allows connections to be created as part of a scenario.  Create a simple, single module scenario for each software and create the connection as part of that scenario.  See this linked [Integromat article](https://www.integromat.com/en/help/connecting-to-services) for general info about connections.  

* Client’s Wild Apricot account \(using Invoices and/or Donations\) 
  * Full admin access is accessible to create Webhooks in Wild Apricot



* Client’s QuickBooks Online account \(configured for Company’s requirements\) or Quickbooks Desktop file - using a sandbox copy of the QuickBooks Company is suggested for initial testing



* Client’s Integromat account \(Basic level or higher - requires 2 Data Stores\) 
  * Admin access accessible to do the Cloning and Config steps



* Client’s online storage account \(Box, DropBox,OneDrive, etc.\) used for storing the WAQM output files for Quickbooks Desktop versions.  This is not required for Quickbooks Online
  * WAQM currently supports “Box” or OneDrive, but it can be updated to other services.
